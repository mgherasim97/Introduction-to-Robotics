        ||
        ||
     FREE SPACE
        ||
        ||
      Each button press makes the bird to fly up for 2 matrix pixels, then the bird descends at a preset speed. You have to
 push the button regularly in order to keep the bird flying (you can also keep the button pressed in order to make the bird ascend faster).
      The objective is for the bird to pass through the FREE SPACE, each succesful pass incrementing the current score by 1. 
      The pipes will move from the right side to the left side, with the bird having a STATIC column but changing line
